The odin-recipes project main object is to be used to the developer's environment and the essential tools through practice of:

- The foundations of HTML (elements, tags, boilerplate, working with text, lists, links,images and commits messages).

- The git basic workflow ( create a repository, move that repository onto a local machine and do atomic commits).

- The basic commands line ( create and manipulate files and directories on the terminal).

- The text editor in relation with git, github, and the terminal.
